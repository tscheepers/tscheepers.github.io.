					Welcome! I'm Thijs, a software product and AI engineer.
				</p>
				<p>
					In <em>2010</em> I co-founded <a href="https://305.nl">Label305</a>, an engineering consultancy for software products. Label305 helps clients by crafting their next user-friendly software product which should either enrich their existing products, or be ready to become a business in its own right. I moved on to new challanges late <em>2020</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					From its origin in <em>2017</em> until <em>2020</em>, I was the product and technical lead of Label305's own software product: <a href="https://keeping.nl">Keeping</a>, a beautiful time tracker for the Dutch market.
				</p>
				<p>
					I graduated from the <a href="http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">UvA</a> with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence, and am interested in all things NLP.
