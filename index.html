					Hey, welcome! I‚Äôm Thijs, an artificial intelligence and software geek based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
				</p>
				<p>
					Back in 2010, I co-founded a company which would turn into <a href="http://label305.com">Label305, a digital product consultancy</a>. We help entrepreneurs and enterprises realize completely new digital products. That could mean: diving in and designing a robust application architecture; implementing a companion mobile application; scaling up your backend infrastructure; or helping out and start improving your internal development process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since its inception, I'm the product lead for our internally developed SaaS product: <a href="https://keeping.nl">Keeping, a beautiful time tracker for the Dutch market</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2017 I graduated cum laude from the <a href="http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html">UvA</a> with a MSc in Artificial Intelligence. I'm very interested in everything related to Natural Language Processing, and AI in general. Going forward I will work to incorporate AI into the products we create at Label305.
